My Simple Lisp Implementation
================================

Over a part of the summer I have been fiddling with [SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) and while it's on hold right now, I thought it'd be cool to try to make a simple LISP parser in a language I know.
LISP seems to be a pretty easy language to parse because of all its lovely parentheses. 

This is a very very basic implementation which barely does anything. But it was fun and I enjoyed toying around with it.
I might try to extend it when I got some more free time on my hands.

The structure of the file is based on other implementations found on GitHub. The parsing and evaluation is more or less done by myself.
